   2. to plot the network
   3. to produce descriptive statistics about relevant node-level properties 
      (e.g., betweeness centrality)
   4. to asssess how and to what extent the network shows a modular structure
      (e.g., a community or core-periphery structure)
   5. to assess the consequences of the modular structure for 
      the individual nodes, the individual communities, and/or the functioning
